</h1> My first Blog Post! </h1>
<p>By: James Burdick             Date:  8 June, 2025</p>
<h2>Welcome to my blog! </h2>

<p>Here, I will share my journey of learning math and technology.</p>
<p>
    If you have not clicked the about me section, I'll give a quick summary. My name is James Burdick
    (duh you read the url) and I love to learn! I am a full time student, a father and husband. for 4 years I 
    was a self-taught Diesel Mechanic, but I have always had a passion for math and technology. I was a stay at
    home dad for 6 months (mad repsect to all the stay at home parents out there) and fortunatly I was able to go to school 
    full time and I plan on switching careers. I am a currently enrolled in a Software Development program online. Not only
    am I interested in software devlopment, I have a wide range of interests in technology. It all started in middle school 
    when I learned BASIC and Scratch. It was super fun as a kid. For some reason I felt like I was not smart enought to pursue 
    a career in that area, and as a young adult I was never really sure what I should do. I was in my early 20s newly married 
    and now a baby on the way and I knew I needed to make money quick. Thankfuly with hard work and being giving me a chance, 
    I was able to get into the Diesel Mechanic trade and learn so much, eventually making as much as 29 dollars an hour with
    only 3 years experince. It wasn't until later my wife encouraged me to pursure a career in tech back in 2022. It would 
    slowly grow, and althouhg I would not have the time to pursue it (working 70 hours a week as a Diesel tech), I would always 
    find myself watching Youtube videos about programming, and wondering how I could learn more about it. Now here I am really 
    trying to put myself out there and learn as much as I can about programming, math, and technology.
</p>
<p>
    I would say that I am a jack of all trades, but master of none when it came to being a Diesel Mechanic, I loved to learn about 
    the different systems on the trucks and trailers. I would get easily bored doing the same thing over and over again,
    and loved seeing a vararity of semi-trucks, construction equiptment and trailers in all the different areas I worked 
    I was even able to get into HVAC-R and learn about the different systems on the reefer trailers. I loved to learn about
    the software and elctronics behind everything. Realizing how it was all IoT and how much linux runs the world.
    I am very intersted in IT and learning about computer networking and also system administration, I also find 
    data science to be very facinating, and it requires a lot of math skills, which I love! I also am interested in 
    system engineering and am looking into the C language and learning more about how computers work at a low level.
    I am type of person who loves to learn new things and amd always looking for new challenges. As a Diesel Mechanic,
    my favorite part of the job was sucessfully diagnosing and fixing a problem. I hope I can transfer that passion
    into my new career in software development and fix many problems, and also build and create new things.
    I hope you will enjoy exploring this humble site and I might also add randowm stuff I enjoy, such as cooking and baking, 
    working out, fixing things and learning new skills.  
</p>
<h2>First Blog Post!</h2>

<p>I know this looks really ugly. I have been wanting trying to create my blog forever, yet for one reason 
    or another I have not had the opportunity to actually follow through with my blog.
    I was debating on whether I sould make a WordPress site or not, but in the end
    I felt like it would be best to practice my coding, therefore, it's going to have crappy HTML and CSS, 
    so bear with me as I continue to update this blog while I learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will try 
    to add material as often as I can.
</p>
<h2>Improving Web Design skills!</h2>
<p>
    The first thing that I am working on learning more is HTML and CSS. I have been going through some Udemy
    course and I have been learning a lot, but sometimes I am just only copying what they are doing. So I hope
    my blog will be a nice playground for me to practice my skills without heavly relying on the course. I also 
    reference a lot of doumentation, such as MDN and of course watch a lot of Youtube videos. I have also taken 1
    course at my community college on PHP and MySQL, so I have a basic understanding of how to use PHP and MySQL. I hope I can utilize
    that knowledge to make this blog more dynamic and interactive. I plan on using PHP to create a simple log-in system
    and a simple comment system, so that I can interact with my readers.

<h2>Messing with Linux and Widows Servers</h2>
<p>
    About 1 year ago, when we moved back from Utah to where we were originally from California. I was working for 
    a reefer dealership and I was very busy in the summer fixing reefers on trucks and trailers. When I would get home after
    all of my family responsibilities were done, I would do a lot of reasearch on Linux and servers in general. My wife found a Dell
    Optiplex 9020 on Facebook Marketplace for $60. It was a nice deal because it came with a mouse, keyboard and an old
    moniter. It came with a intel core i5 and 32GB of RAM. For the next two weeks I would struggle attempting to boot CentOS Stream 9.
    It just would not boot. I watched countless Youtube videos and read countless articles on how to install it, but I just could not get it to work.
    I was so frustrated that I almost gave up, but I decided to try one more time. I was really interested in learning the RHEL family of 
    distros, and I ran into AlmaLinux. I had never heard of it before, but I decided to give it a try. I downloaded the ISO and burned it to a USB drive.
    I booted the computer and it worked! I was so happy that I finally got a Linux distro to work on my computer. Unfortunatly after sucessfully installing
    AlmaLinux, I was not able to get the network to work. It has been a long time since I have gone back to the project. And I will 
    be honest, I do feel a bit discouraged that I was not able to get it to work, but I am determined to set up a local network outside of my 
    regular home network to start learning about networking and servers. I plan on also using another tower I have to probably practice virtulization with 
    Hyper-V or Proxmox. I have not decided yet. Maybe even VMware ESXi. I hope with this I can toy around with Windows Server and Linux servers.
</p>
<h2>Data Science</h2>

<p> My interest in data science has acually come up the past few weeks. It all started with me going back to college a few months ago. 
    LIke I said my wife helped re-spark my interst in learning about web development and had actually started my journey with HTML and CSS in 2022, when we 
    were living in Utah. Fast forward and back in California, and I had kind of given up on pursuing the who idea of going into tech. It felt
    too hard, and too competitive. I would look at job posting and in my area there was really nothing with software developer roles.
    And the IT roles either required a degree or a lot of experince. I had then decided to look into different areas. I realized I always loved history
    and I re-enrolled in college to pursue a degree in history after a long break. I was so excited to learn about history again, but I was not happy with the classes I was taking.
    I felt frustrated with all the reading and writing assignments. I was not enjoying it at all. I then realized something that I could try, and that was Math. 
    I honestly was never the best at math. I was alright at it, and always got Bs and one C in Geometry. I had decdied I would challenge myself and enroll in
    Calculus 1 in the summer. It was so cool learning about limits and derviatives. I realized after doing some reasearch, that this math can be applied in data
    science. Unfortunatly, I was not able to finish the class as I had to drop with a W due to not being able to keep up with the 6 week pase of the class. keep
    in mind it was a 6 week class and I have not taken an alegbra class in 9 years. More details will be on a future blog post, but I just wanted to talk about 
    how me taking that class, helped me realized that you can acually apply math to real world problems, especially in data science. I am also excited to 
    express that I have gottened some old cheap used textbooks to use to self-study algebra and trigonometry. I hope I can make it to Calculus and beyond and apply
    it to any data science projects I may have in the future. It also helped me realized my life situation and what will work best for my family, and it lead to 
    me enroling in a Software Development program online and also work on some tech certs at my local community college.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    I hope you enjoyed reading my first blog post. I know it is a bit long, but I wanted to share my journey and my interests in technology.
    I hope to continue to update this blog with more posts about my journey and what I am learning. I also hope to share some of my projects
    and what I am working on. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me on the contact page. I plan on connecting to all the 
    socal media platforms, so you can follow me there as well. Also the fact if you made it here and you are still reading makes me so grateful
